# Differential Expression Meta-Analysis of NGS Datasets to Classify Chronic Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis

## Abstract 
**Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (cHP)** is an interstitial lung disease (ILD) driven by aberrant immune response that often progresses to pulmonary fibrosis and exhibits substantial clinical, radiological, and histopathological overlap with **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)**. This overlap frequently leads to misdiagnosis and delays in appropriate therapeutic intervention. To identify robust molecular signatures that discriminate between these overlapping ILD subtypes, we performed ***differential expression meta-analysis*** of next-generation sequencing (NGS) transcriptomic datasets (GSE184316 and GSE150910). Integration using the ***Fused Inverse Normal (FINM)*** framework identified **380 significantly dysregulated genes** between cHP and IPF. Gene ontology enrichment highlighted immune- and receptor-mediated signaling predominating in cHP, whereas IPF was enriched for developmental and fibrotic remodeling pathways. ***Minimum redundancy–maximum relevance (mRMR)*** feature ranking followed by ***LASSO regression*** yielded a parsimonious **three-gene panel (ZNF443, GBP4, RNF208)** with strong discriminatory accuracy **(AUC = 0.921; 95% CI: 0.851–0.991)**. Future validation in patient population is necessary to establish the candidate genes as a potential biomarker panel.
